# Flex inference















**Note:** This version of the page covers the **Interactions API**. You can use the toggle on this page to switch to the [generateContent API version of this page](/gemini-api/docs/generate-content/flex-inference).**Preview:** The Gemini Flex API is in
[Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages).

The Gemini Flex API is an inference tier that offers a 50% cost reduction
compared to standard rates, in exchange for variable latency and best-effort
availability. It's designed for latency-tolerant workloads that require
synchronous processing but don't need the real-time performance of the standard
API.

## How to use Flex

To use the Flex tier, specify the `service_tier` as `flex` in your request. By default, requests use the standard tier if this field is omitted.

### Python

```
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

interaction = client.interactions.create(
 model="gemini-3.5-flash",
 input="Analyze this dataset for trends...",
 service_tier='flex'
)
print(interaction.output_text)

```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from '@google/genai';

const client = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
 const interaction = await client.interactions.create({
 model: 'gemini-3.5-flash',
 input: 'Analyze this dataset for trends...',
 service_tier: 'flex'
 });
 console.log(interaction.output_text);
}
await main();

```

### REST

```
curl -X POST "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
 -d '{
 "model": "gemini-3.5-flash",
 "input": "Analyze this dataset for trends...",
 "service_tier": "flex"
 }'

```

## How Flex inference works

Gemini Flex inference bridges the gap between the standard API and the 24-hour
turnaround of the [Batch API](/gemini-api/docs/batch-api). It utilizes off-peak,
"sheddable" compute capacity to provide a cost-effective solution for background
tasks and sequential workflows.

### Key benefits

- **Cost efficiency**: Substantial savings for non-production evals, background agents, and data enrichment.
- **Low friction**: Simply add a single parameter to your existing requests.
- **Synchronous workflows**: Ideal for sequential API chains where the next request depends on the output of the previous one, making it more flexible than Batch for agentic workflows.

### Use cases

- **Offline evaluations**: Running "LLM-as-a-judge" regression tests or leaderboards.
- **Background agents**: Sequential tasks like CRM updates, profile building, or content moderation where minutes of delay are acceptable.
- **Budget-constrained research**: Academic experiments that require high token volume on a limited budget.

### Rate limits

Flex inference traffic counts towards your general [rate limits](https://aistudio.google.com/rate-limit); it doesn't
offer extended rate limits like the [Batch API](/gemini-api/docs/batch-api).

### Sheddable capacity

Flex traffic is treated with lower priority. If there is a spike in
standard traffic, Flex requests may be preempted or evicted to ensure capacity
for high-priority users. If you're looking for high-priority inference, check
[Priority inference](/gemini-api/docs/priority-inference)

### Error codes

When Flex capacity is unavailable or the system is congested, the API will
return standard error codes:

- **503 Service Unavailable**: The system is currently at capacity.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limits or resource exhaustion.

### Client responsibility

- **No server-side fallback**: To prevent unexpected charges, the system won't
automatically upgrade a Flex request to the Standard tier if Flex capacity is
full.
- **Retries**: You must implement your own client-side retry logic with
exponential backoff.
- **Timeouts**: Because Flex requests may sit in a queue, we recommend
increasing client-side timeouts to 10 minutes or more to avoid premature
connection closure.

## Adjust timeout windows

You can configure per-request timeouts for the REST API and client libraries.
Always ensure your client-side timeout covers the intended server patience
window (e.g., 600s+ for Flex wait queues). The SDKs expect timeout values in
milliseconds.

### Per-request timeouts

### Python

```
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(http_options={"timeout": 900000})

interaction = client.interactions.create(
 model="gemini-3.5-flash",
 input="why is the sky blue?",
 service_tier="flex",
)

```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from '@google/genai';

const client = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
 const interaction = await client.interactions.create({
 model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
 input: "why is the sky blue?",
 service_tier: "flex",
 }, {timeout: 900000});
}

await main();

```

## Implement retries

Because Flex is sheddable and fails with 503 errors, here is an example of
optionally implementing retry logic to continue with failed requests:

### Python

```
import time
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

def call_with_retry(max_retries=3, base_delay=5):
 for attempt in range(max_retries):
 try:
 return client.interactions.create(
 model="gemini-3.5-flash",
 input="Analyze this batch statement.",
 service_tier="flex",
 )
 except Exception as e:
 if attempt < max_retries - 1:
 delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt) # Exponential Backoff
 print(f"Flex busy, retrying in {delay}s...")
 time.sleep(delay)
 else:
 print("Flex exhausted, falling back to Standard...")
 return client.interactions.create(
 model="gemini-3.5-flash",
 input="Analyze this batch statement."
 )

interaction = call_with_retry()
print(interaction.output_text)

```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from '@google/genai';

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function sleep(ms) {
 return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

async function callWithRetry(maxRetries = 3, baseDelay = 5) {
 for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
 try {
 console.log(`Attempt ${attempt + 1}: Calling Flex tier...`);
 const interaction = await ai.interactions.create({
 model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
 input: "Analyze this batch statement.",
 service_tier: 'flex',
 });
 return interaction;
 } catch (e) {
 if (attempt < maxRetries - 1) {
 const delay = baseDelay * (2 ** attempt);
 console.log(`Flex busy, retrying in ${delay}s...`);
 await sleep(delay * 1000);
 } else {
 console.log("Flex exhausted, falling back to Standard...");
 return await ai.interactions.create({
 model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
 input: "Analyze this batch statement.",
 });
 }
 }
 }
}

async function main() {
 const interaction = await callWithRetry();
 console.log(interaction.output_text);
}

await main();

```
