The [Interactions API](/gemini-api/docs/interactions-overview) is now generally available. We recommend using this API for access to all the latest features and models.

# Gemini Developer API vs. Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform















When developing generative AI solutions with Gemini, Google offers two API products:
the [Gemini Developer API](/gemini-api/docs) and the [Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/overview).

The Gemini Developer API provides the fastest path to build, productionize, and
scale Gemini powered applications. Most developers should use the Gemini Developer
API unless there is a need for specific enterprise controls.

Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem of enterprise ready features and services
for building and deploying generative AI applications backed by the Google Cloud Platform.

We've recently simplified migrating between these services. Both the Gemini
Developer API and the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API are now accessible through the unified
[Google Gen AI SDK](/gemini-api/docs/libraries).

## Code comparison

This page has side-by-side code comparisons between Gemini Developer API and
Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform quickstarts for text generation.

### Python

You can access both the Gemini Developer API and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform services through
the `google-genai` library. See the [libraries](/gemini-api/docs/libraries) page
for instructions on how to install `google-genai`.

### Gemini Developer API

```
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
 model="gemini-3.5-flash", contents="Explain how AI works in a few words"
)
print(response.text)

```

### Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API

```
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(
 vertexai=True, project='your-project-id', location='us-central1'
)

response = client.models.generate_content(
 model="gemini-3.5-flash", contents="Explain how AI works in a few words"
)
print(response.text)

```

### JavaScript and TypeScript

You can access both Gemini Developer API and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform services through `@google/genai`
library. See [libraries](/gemini-api/docs/libraries) page for instructions on how
to install `@google/genai`.

### Gemini Developer API

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
 const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
 model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
 contents: "Explain how AI works in a few words",
 });
 console.log(response.text);
}

main();

```

### Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from '@google/genai';
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({
 vertexai: true,
 project: 'your_project',
 location: 'your_location',
});

async function main() {
 const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
 model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
 contents: "Explain how AI works in a few words",
 });
 console.log(response.text);
}

main();

```

### Go

You can access both Gemini Developer API and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform services through `google.golang.org/genai`
library. See [libraries](/gemini-api/docs/libraries) page for instructions on how
to install `google.golang.org/genai`.

### Gemini Developer API

```
import (
 "context"
 "encoding/json"
 "fmt"
 "log"
 "google.golang.org/genai"
)

// Your Google API key
const apiKey = "your-api-key"

func main() {
 ctx := context.Background()
 client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, nil)
 if err != nil {
 log.Fatal(err)
 }

 // Call the GenerateContent method.
 result, err := client.Models.GenerateContent(ctx, "gemini-3.5-flash", genai.Text("Tell me about New York?"), nil)

}

```

### Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API

```
import (
 "context"
 "encoding/json"
 "fmt"
 "log"
 "google.golang.org/genai"
)

// Your GCP project
const project = "your-project"

// A GCP location like "us-central1"
const location = "some-gcp-location"

func main() {
 ctx := context.Background()
 client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, &genai.ClientConfig
 {
 Project: project,
 Location: location,
 Backend: genai.BackendVertexAI,
 })

 // Call the GenerateContent method.
 result, err := client.Models.GenerateContent(ctx, "gemini-3.5-flash", genai.Text("Tell me about New York?"), nil)

}

```

### Other use cases and platforms

Refer to use case specific guides on [Gemini Developer API Documentation](/gemini-api/docs)
and [Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform documentation](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/generative-ai/docs/overview)
for other platforms and use cases.

## Migration considerations

When you migrate:

-
You'll need to use Google Cloud service accounts to authenticate. See the [Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform documentation](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/generative-ai/docs/overview)
for more information.

-
You can use your existing Google Cloud project
(the same one you used to generate your API key) or you can
[create a new Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

-
Supported regions may differ between the Gemini Developer API and the
Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API. See the list of
[supported regions for generative AI on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations-genai).

-
Any models you created in Google AI Studio need to be retrained in Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform.

If you no longer need to use your Gemini API key for the Gemini Developer API,
then follow security best practices and delete it.

To delete an API key:

-
Open the
[Google Cloud API Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
page.

-
Find the API key you want to delete and click the **Actions** icon.

-
Select **Delete API key**.

-
In the **Delete credential** modal, select **Delete**.

Deleting an API key takes a few minutes to propagate. After
propagation completes, any traffic using the deleted API key is rejected.

**Important:** If you have deleted a key that is still used in production and need
to recover it, see
[gcloud beta services api-keys undelete](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/services/api-keys/undelete).

## Next steps

[Generative AI on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/overview)
to learn more about generative AI solutions on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform.
