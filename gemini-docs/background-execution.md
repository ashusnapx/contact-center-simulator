# Background execution

















For long-running tasks like deep research, complex reasoning, or multi-step agent executions, connection timeouts can interrupt standard HTTP requests (which typically close after 60 seconds). The [Interactions API](/gemini-api/docs/interactions-overview) provides **background execution** to run these tasks asynchronously.

To let the interaction run until it completes the task on the server, set `"background": true` when creating the interaction. The API immediately returns an interaction ID, which client applications can use to poll for status, stream progress, or reconnect to a disconnected stream.

Background execution is supported for standard Gemini models (such as `gemini-3.5-flash` and `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`) and Managed Agents (such as `antigravity-preview-05-2026`).

## Create a background interaction

To start a background interaction, set the `background` parameter to `true` when creating the resource.

### Python

```
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

interaction = client.interactions.create(
 model="gemini-3.5-flash",
 input="Write a guide on space exploration.",
 background=True,
)
print(f"Created background interaction ID: {interaction.id}")

```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const client = new GoogleGenAI({});

const interaction = await client.interactions.create({
 model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
 input: "Write a guide on space exploration.",
 background: true,
});
console.log(`Created background interaction ID: ${interaction.id}`);

```

### REST

```
curl -X POST "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions" \
 -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "Api-Revision: 2026-05-20" \
 -d '{
 "model": "gemini-3.5-flash",
 "input": "Write a guide on space exploration.",
 "background": true
 }'

```

## How background execution works

When you create a background interaction, the task runs asynchronously on the server. The interaction transitions through various execution states:

- `in_progress`: The server is actively executing the interaction (such as running code or researching).
- `requires_action`: The interaction has paused and is waiting for client input (such as confirming a tool execution or answering a question).
- `completed`: The interaction finished successfully and the output is available.
- `failed`: An error occurred during execution (such as tool failure or rate limits).
- `cancelled`: A client request stopped the execution.

 **Note:** For the complete list of interaction states, see the
 [Interactions API Reference](https://ai.google.dev/api/interactions-api#Resource:Interaction).

### Use cases

Use background execution for:

-
**Agent executions:** Tasks requiring code execution, web browsing, or sub-agent orchestration (such as `antigravity-preview-05-2026`).

-
**Deep research:** Runs using `deep-research-preview-04-2026` or `deep-research-max-preview-04-2026` which take several minutes.

-
**Long reasoning:** Tasks where model thinking steps exceed standard HTTP connection limits.

## Retrieve results

Obtain background interaction results using either **polling** or **streaming**.

### Polling pattern (non-blocking)

Polling checks the interaction status periodically using non-blocking GET requests until it reaches a terminal state.

### Python

```
import time
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

interaction = client.interactions.get(id="YOUR_INTERACTION_ID")

while interaction.status == "in_progress":
 time.sleep(5)
 interaction = client.interactions.get(id=interaction.id)

if interaction.status == "completed":
 print(interaction.output_text)
else:
 print(f"Finished with status: {interaction.status}")

```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const client = new GoogleGenAI({});

let interaction = await client.interactions.get("YOUR_INTERACTION_ID");

while (interaction.status === "in_progress") {
 await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
 interaction = await client.interactions.get(interaction.id);
}

if (interaction.status === "completed") {
 console.log(interaction.output_text);
} else {
 console.log(`Finished with status: ${interaction.status}`);
}

```

### REST

```
curl -X GET "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions/YOUR_INTERACTION_ID" \
 -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
 -H "Api-Revision: 2026-05-20"

```

### Streaming pattern

If a network interruption disconnects a stream, streaming can resume from the last received event. Each delta contains a unique `event_id` in its payload. Passing this ID as `last_event_id` resumes the stream from that event.

### Python

```
import time
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()
interaction_id = "YOUR_INTERACTION_ID"

def stream_with_reconnect(interaction_id: str):
 last_event_id = None
 while True:
 try:
 # Retrieve the stream. If resuming, pass last_event_id
 stream = client.interactions.get(
 id=interaction_id,
 stream=True,
 last_event_id=last_event_id
 )

 for event in stream:
 # Log event updates and capture event_id if present
 if event.event_id:
 last_event_id = event.event_id

 if event.event_type == "step.delta" and event.delta.type == "text":
 print(event.delta.text, end="", flush=True)

 if event.event_type == "interaction.completed":
 return

 except Exception as e:
 print(f"\n[Connection lost: {e}. Reconnecting in 3s...]")
 time.sleep(3)

stream_with_reconnect(interaction_id)

```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const client = new GoogleGenAI({});
const interactionId = "YOUR_INTERACTION_ID";

async function streamWithReconnect(id) {
 let lastEventId = undefined;
 while (true) {
 try {
 // Retrieve the stream. If resuming, pass last_event_id in options
 const stream = await client.interactions.get(id, {
 stream: true,
 last_event_id: lastEventId
 });

 for await (const event of stream) {
 // Capture event_id if present
 const idVal = event.event_id || event.id;
 if (idVal) {
 lastEventId = idVal;
 }

 if (event.event_type === "step.delta" && event.delta?.type === "text") {
 process.stdout.write(event.delta.text);
 }

 if (event.event_type === "interaction.completed") {
 return;
 }
 }
 } catch (error) {
 console.log(`\n[Connection lost: ${error.message}. Reconnecting in 3s...]`);
 await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
 }
 }
}

await streamWithReconnect(interactionId);

```

### REST

```
curl -N -X GET "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions/YOUR_INTERACTION_ID?stream=true&last_event_id=YOUR_LAST_EVENT_ID" \
 -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
 -H "Api-Revision: 2026-05-20"

```

## Multi-turn conversations

Subsequent interactions can chain to a background conversation using `previous_interaction_id`, subject to these constraints:

- **Active executions are blocked:** Chaining a subsequent interaction to one with `in_progress` status returns a `400 Bad Request` error. Wait for the interaction to reach the `completed` state before starting the next one.
- **Environment Parameter for Managed Agents:** When chaining interactions for Managed Agents (such as `antigravity-preview-05-2026`), requests must include both `previous_interaction_id` and `environment`.

The following examples show how to chain interactions:

### Python

```
import time
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()
agent_model = "antigravity-preview-05-2026"

# First interaction: Provision sandbox environment and execute first instruction
interaction1 = client.interactions.create(
 model=agent_model,
 input="Create a folder named project/ and write hello.py inside.",
 environment="remote",
 background=True
)

# Wait for completion
while True:
 check = client.interactions.get(id=interaction1.id)
 if check.status != "in_progress":
 break
 time.sleep(2)

# Second interaction: Chain using previous_interaction_id and environment
interaction2 = client.interactions.create(
 model=agent_model,
 input="List all files in the project/ directory.",
 previous_interaction_id=interaction1.id,
 environment="remote",
 background=True
)

```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const client = new GoogleGenAI({});
const agentModel = "antigravity-preview-05-2026";

// First interaction: Provision sandbox environment and execute first instruction
const interaction1 = await client.interactions.create({
 model: agentModel,
 input: "Create a folder named project/ and write hello.py inside.",
 environment: "remote",
 background: true
});

// Wait for completion
while (true) {
 const check = await client.interactions.get(interaction1.id);
 if (check.status !== "in_progress") {
 break;
 }
 await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
}

// Second interaction: Chain using previous_interaction_id and environment
const interaction2 = await client.interactions.create({
 model: agentModel,
 input: "List all files in the project/ directory.",
 previous_interaction_id: interaction1.id,
 environment: "remote",
 background: true
});

```

### REST

```
# Chain second interaction (Make sure FIRST_INTERACTION_ID has status 'completed')
curl -X POST "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions" \
 -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "Api-Revision: 2026-05-20" \
 -d '{
 "model": "antigravity-preview-05-2026",
 "input": "List all files in the project/ directory.",
 "previous_interaction_id": "FIRST_INTERACTION_ID",
 "environment": "remote",
 "background": true
 }'

```

## Cancellation and deletion

Control running executions and manage storage using cancel and delete requests:

- **Cancel (`POST /interactions/{id}/cancel`):** Stops the running task. The status transitions to `cancelled`. Clean-up actions on the server can cause a slight delay before the status updates in GET requests.
-
**Delete (`DELETE /interactions/{id}`):** Removes the interaction records from the server. Subsequent GET requests return a `404 Not Found` error.

### Python

```
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

# Cancel a running interaction
client.interactions.cancel(id="YOUR_INTERACTION_ID")

# Delete the interaction record entirely
client.interactions.delete(id="YOUR_INTERACTION_ID")

```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const client = new GoogleGenAI({});

// Cancel a running interaction
await client.interactions.cancel("YOUR_INTERACTION_ID");

// Delete the interaction record entirely
await client.interactions.delete("YOUR_INTERACTION_ID");

```

### REST

```
# Cancel the interaction
curl -X POST "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions/YOUR_INTERACTION_ID/cancel" \
 -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
 -H "Api-Revision: 2026-05-20"

# Delete the interaction
curl -X DELETE "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions/YOUR_INTERACTION_ID" \
 -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
 -H "Api-Revision: 2026-05-20"

```
